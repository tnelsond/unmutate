OKAY, IN THAT LAST LEVEL EACH CREATURE HAD 2 COPIES OF THE LEG LENGTH GENES. THERE WERE ONLY 2 ALLELES (VARIATIONS OF THE GENE) LONG LENGTH, AND SHORT LENGTH. BUT IF A CREATURE HAD ONE OF EACH ALLELE THEN IT HAD MEDIUM LENGTH LEGS. THAT SORTA THING IS CALLED CODOMINANCE.

WELL NOT ALL INHERITANCE WORKS THAT WAY. SO IN THIS LEVEL A CREATURE WILL BE BLUE IF IT HAS AT LEAST ONE OF THE ALLELES FOR BLUE SKIN COLOR. BUT THERE'S ALSO AN ALLELE FOR PINK SKIN COLOR, BUT IT IS RECESSIVE SO A CREATURE NEEDS 2 COPIES OF IT, OTHERWISE ITS SKIN WILL BE BLUE. SO A CREATURE THAT HAS ONE BLUE ALLELE AND ONE PINK ALLELE WILL BE BLUE. AND A CREATURE WITH TWO PINK ALLELES WILL BE PINK.
